Flat Filtering Model-Free Control of Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Above Rated Wind  Speed with Radial Basis Function Neural Network Repository

The following software programs were used in the research:
1. TurbSim Version 1.50 to generate the stochastic wind profiles [URL](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/turbsim).
2. PyDatView v0.4-0 to view and analyze the generated stochastic wind profiles [URL](https://github.com/ebranlard/pyDatView/releases).
3.
